### Request Time Util

This utility allows you to calculate network performance.
It sends requests to various resources in parallel.

As a result we get:
- the time during which all requests have been processed
- average time per request
- max/min response time
- the number of answers that were not received

Use the following keys:
- number of requests (-c)
- timeout in ms (-t)
